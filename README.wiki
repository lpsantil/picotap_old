= picotap - A tiny TAP generator library and TAP parser in C & JavaScript =

== Version 0.0.1 ==

== Date: 2013-04-26 ==

== Introduction ==
picotap is a tiny TAP generator library (test) and TAP parser (test harness) written in C and JavaScript (Browser & OneMonkey JS).  It was inspired by code in kazuho's github projects.

== Prequisites ==
C Prequisites:
* tap requires that Boehm GC be installed to compile

JS Prequisites:
* Browser: console.log
* CLI: OneMonkey JS (v8-based) interpreter

If you get stuck, try typing '''make help''' or looking at the Examples directory.

== Examples ==
=== Making a TAP generator (a test) in C ===
* In '''./picotap''', type:
 make libtap
* Include tap.h into your test file
* Start your test source with
 plan( 10 ); // If your test plan includes 10 tests
* Each test is of the form
 ok( condition, "Info about the test" );
* '''condition''' can be any expression that resolves to true/false
* For output to stdout not part of the test plan results
** Prefix with a '''space''', '''tab''', or '''#'''
* Compile your test code by including the path to '''tap.h''' and linking to '''libtap.o'''
 cc test.c -I./picotap libtap.o -o test.exe
* See the '''picotap/Examples''' directory and the '''make examples''' command in '''picotap/Makefile'''

=== Making a TAP generator (a test) in JS (HTML) ===
* Add '''libtap.js''' to your web folder
* Include '''libtap.js''' in your in HTML file
 <script src="libtap.js"></script>
* Create test plan
 <script>
 tap.plan( 2 );
 tap.ok( true, "True is always true" );
 tap.ok( !false, "Not False is true too" );
 tap.done();
 </script>
* For output to console.log not part of the test plan results
** Prefix with a '''space''', '''tab''', or '''#'''
* Load the HTML file into your browser
* Verify the TAP results in the JS Console

=== Making a TAP parser run (test harness) in C ===
* In '''./picotap''', type:
 make tap
* Execute the test via the tap parser
 ./tap /PATH/TO/test.exe
* '''tap''' will open a pipe to '''test.exe''', reading its stdout and parse it
* For output to stdout not part of the test plan results
** Prefix with a '''space''', '''tab''', or '''#'''

=== Making a TAP parser run (test harness) in JS (HTML) ===
* Add '''libtap.js''' and '''tap.js''' to your web folder
* Include '''libtap.js''' and '''tap.js''' in your in HTML file
 <script src="libtap.js"></script>
 <script src="tap.js"></script>
* Create test plan
 <script>
 tap.plan( 2 );
 tap.ok( true, "True is always true" );
 tap.ok( !false, "Not False is true too" );
 tap.done();
 </script>
* Execute the TAP parser
 <script>
 main( [ "tap.js", tap.doc ] );
 </script>	
* For output to console.log not part of the test plan results
** Prefix with a '''space''', '''tab''', or '''#'''
* Load the HTML file into your browser
* Verify the TAP parser results in the JS Console
